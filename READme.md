# Backend Note Builder
  
  ## Description:
  The main goal of this project is to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. The application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application will be deployed on Heroku. After completion of the project, I have a better understanding	 of building RESTful APIs with Node.js through the Express.js framework.  I also learned how to use API request methods along with their respective routes. And lastly I learned some better ways to refactor and format the code, making it easier to read and modify.  For instance, instead of having the then() method on the same line as the function, all then/catch methods independently have their own line.
